# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction (ML Project)

This project is a basic machine learning model built to predict student performance. It explores how different features (like study time, attendance, and behavior) can influence academic outcomes.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand the machine learning workflow (data prep, model training, evaluation)
- Simulate how a model could predict student outcomes (e.g., Pass/Fail or grade)

> Note: This project currently **does not use a real dataset**. Sample or dummy data is used for testing and development purposes.

## 💡 What This Project Includes

- Data simulation (creating sample student records)
- Feature selection and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest (optional)
- Accuracy score and confusion matrix for evaluation

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Install Python (if not installed)
2. Install the required packages:
## 🚧 Future Improvements

- Add real dataset (e.g., UCI student dataset)
- Improve feature engineering
- Deploy the model on a web interface (e.g., using Streamlit)
